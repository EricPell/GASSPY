This is the placeholder for get line profile.

Integrate the line intensity along the line of sight into predefined spectral bins.

We do this in delta-velocity space, using the velocity relative to the grid.

Required information
1. Line profile
2. Instrument resolving power or spectral resolution
3. Delta velocity bin width (min/max)
4. Optional in wavelength space (useful for predictions of narrow band filter fluxes)
5. Optional  (default)- use thermal width (thermal temperature from cell). Could be useful in searching for 
turbulence or macroscopic motion that is convolved with thermal broadening.
6. Simple extinction due to dust
